# Experiment

Testing out the capabilities of normalizr in conjunction with TypeScript.
Looks like with a small update / overload to the normalizr library you can get autocomplete working

## Steps

1. Link an interface to a schema
2. normalize some data
3. denormalizing it should enable type checking on the returned value

## Development

This project has been bootstrapped using **vite**

`npm i` - install dependencies, first
`npm run dev` - starts the development server
